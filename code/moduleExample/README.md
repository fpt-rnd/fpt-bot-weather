**What is a module in Nodejs?**
Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.
A set of functions you want to include in your application.

**Include Modules**
To include a module, use the require() function with the name of the module.

**Create Your Own Modules**
You can create your own modules, and easily include them in your applications.
Example file my_first_module.js
Use the exports keyword to make properties and methods available outside the module file.
